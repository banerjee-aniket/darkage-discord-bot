DarkAge SMP — Information

DarkAge SMP is the official multiplayer survival server for our community.

Website

Official Website: https://darkage-smp.vercel.app/

(The website contains our public-facing info pages, support links, and general server details.)

Server Management / Renew System

If the server is offline, expired, or stopped — players can start or renew the server themselves, without any admin being online.

Important clarification:

The control panel is not hosted on our website.
It is provided by the server host itself on a public panel link.

The public server panel is labeled as:

/manage/renew

When players open that page, they can:

Start the server

Renew it if expired

Bring the SMP online instantly whenever they want


Support & Contributions

Players can support DarkAge SMP by:

Voting for us on TopG (boosts ranking + visibility)

Donating via BuyMeACoffee

Using any other support options listed on the website

Links & Access

General information pages and support links are on the main website: https://darkage-smp.vercel.app/

The actual server control panel (start/renew) is not on our domain — it is a public page provided by our hosting service and is labeled /manage/renew.

Purpose

DarkAge SMP is designed to be:

Community-controlled

Instantly available on demand

Supported through community voting + donations


Players themselves have direct power to bring the server online at any time — no approval required.
